## Summary
[Edusign](https://edusign.com/fr/) is a SaaS platform meant to simplify and digitalize the management of students for teachers and school life for students.
## Description :
This micro-concept is a POC (Proof Of Concept) for a feature mentionned by Edusign's co-founder in one of his [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elliot-boucher_on-bosse-sur-une-app-%C3%A9tudiante-innovante-activity-7292436777036861440-7RU5) regarding users feedback on features they want to see implemented. Job offers was the most asked for feature, hence why I'm giving it a try.
I then designed my ideal version of this part of the app, based on Edusign's branding.
And here is the part of the project dedicated to the development itself. I'm doing a single page with :
- [X] Filters
- [X] Job offers based on user's information
- [X] Request to apply quickly
- [X] Modern pill-shaped floating navbar
- [ ] MAYBE routes to specific offers if I have time
## Was it done from scratch ?
No, I can't put up so many things this quickly while starting up from scratch, I've based most of my logic and code on [Voyage Stoïque](https://github.com/CedricTheveneau/Voyage_Stoique)'s code base to gain time. Though, I took some time to improve upon it a bit and fixed some issues in the code. I only took what I needed though, so don't see it as a full-fledged app like Voyage Stoïque.
## Languages used :
- The front-end of the application uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) without TypeScript.
- The back-end of the application uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), paired with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database paired with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
